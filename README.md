# Project Name: BikerZone

## Project Description:
**BikerZone** is a static, responsive web page built using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **DaisyUI**.  In my previous projects (web_project_7 to web_project_10), I learned Tailwind CSS. Before starting this project, I learned DaisyUI from the official documentation. After that, I started creating this project. My primary goal for this project was to implement my DaisyUI learning and knowledge.

## What I newly learned while building this project:
* How to customize DaisyUi default classes:
```css
    <!-- DaisyUi Customization -->
    <style>
        [data-theme="light"] {
            --color-primary: #E76F51;
            --color-primary-content: #6C6C6C;
        }
    </style>
```

I didn’t learn a lot of new things while building this project because i don't face lot's of trouble while building this project. That’s mainly because i had already faced many problems and challenges while building on `web_project_7` to `web_project_10`. Those past experiences helped me a lot in this project and gave me confidence.
