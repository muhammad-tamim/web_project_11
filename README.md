# Project Name: BikerZone

## Project Description:
**BikerZone** is a static, responsive web page built using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **DaisyUI**.  In my previous projects (web_project_7 to web_project_10), I learned Tailwind CSS. Before starting this project, I learned DaisyUI from the official documentation. After that, I started creating this project. My primary goal for this project was to implement my DaisyUI learning and knowledge.

## What I newly learned while building this project:
I didn’t face any major trouble while building this project, because I had already faced many problems and challenges while working on `web_project_7` to `web_project_10`. Those past experiences helped me a lot in this project and gave me confidence.

So, I didn’t learn anything completely new while building this project — it was more about applying what I had already learned.
